# e2r

A very experimental minimalistic 3D rendering and game engine implementing in Rust language. The focus of the engine to provide basic rendering and game engine modules for the end user. Parts of the code is being ported over from C++ from one of my other projects.

# To be supported:

3D Model Formats: md5mesh, md5anim, obj

Rendering backend: OpenGL 3.3+

Windowing: GLFW

Partitioning of render backend and frontend

Rendering acceleration structures

Rendering mesource management by render backend

Entity instance management by render front end

Multithreading support for front end and some of the back end pipelines
