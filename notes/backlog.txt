proposed components for the infrastructure system:

* stream : core subsystem, one for each stream data type, composite class for multi data type
** broadcast vs directionality control options
* packet inspector interface (complementary to stream) : core subsystem
* packet inspector implementation (complementary to stream) :core subsystem
* packet router interface (to other bus/endpoint consumer or enpoint producer) :core subsystem
* concurrency implementation (need to benchmark latency and throughput)
  
pending modifications:
* replace glm related references and functions with core components ( core/matrix, core/vec, ... ). add computation for frustum.
